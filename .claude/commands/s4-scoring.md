Run step 4 (feature scoring) of the strategy pipeline.

1. Read prior steps from the latest run.
2. Pick the 2-4 competing features from H3 (or wherever prioritization is contested).
3. Define a rubric: 5-7 criteria with weights. Score every feature on EVERY criterion.
   Do NOT compute totals — the renderer computes them from weights. Naked totals are theater.
4. Write output/<run>/04-scoring.json per schema '04-scoring'.
5. Run `node strategy/cli.js status`, fix schema errors.

TOSS-UP RULE: after scoring, compute the weighted totals mentally; if the top two
features land within 10% of each other, the ranking is not robust to weights — you
must either (a) add an explicit weight-sensitivity note showing which weight change
flips the order, or (b) declare the comparison a toss-up and justify the tiebreaker
qualitatively. Never present a <10% gap as a confident 1st/2nd ranking.

V3 — collectionHint (drives the /collect-data dialogue): for every claim you create,
add a short `collectionHint` — where the company would normally find this number
internally (e.g. "billing/Stripe dashboard → churn last month", "product analytics →
activation funnel", "finance sheet → blended cost per seat"). Estimate and null-value
claims especially need it, since those are what /collect-data will ask the user to
confirm. Keep it ≤160 chars. The field is optional in the schema, but omit it only
when no sensible source location exists.

V3.1 — kind (gates what /collect-data may ASK a client): tag every claim with `kind`.
  - "metric"         — an internal company number (churn, MRR, activation, cost base, usage,
                       account mix). These are what the agent collects in dialogue. Give these
                       a collectionHint pointing at where the number lives in the company.
  - "recommendation" — your own proposal or target (a price you recommend, a target rate you
                       set). NOT a fact you ask the client for — confirmed by their agreement or
                       your revision.
  - "benchmark"      — a public, market, or derived fact (competitor pricing from their site,
                       industry rates, a figure computed from public inputs). Confirmed by
                       research, never asked of a client.
Decision rule: "is this a number that lives in THIS company's systems?" → metric. "Did I
propose it?" → recommendation. "Is it public or derived?" → benchmark. A current competitor
price from their website is benchmark, not metric — do not ask a client for it. If unsure, omit
kind; downstream treats absent kind as benchmark (the safe default — never asked of a client).

CORPORATE PRISM (V4.0): if output/<run>/00-corporate.json exists, read it FIRST and subordinate
this step's decisions to its primaryGoal. The same product facts point to different choices under
different company goals (e.g. profitability → outcome/retention-led North Star, lean roadmap,
margin-protective pricing; market-share → adoption-led metric, land-grab roadmap, penetration
pricing; vertical-software-contour → integration/penetration metric, roadmap that closes the
vertical's whole software stack, platform pricing). Honor antiGoals as hard constraints. If this
step's standard move conflicts with the corporate goal, surface the tension explicitly rather than
smoothing it over. If 00-corporate.json is absent, proceed as before.
